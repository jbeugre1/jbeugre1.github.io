    <p>In 2019, we experienced a pandemic that no one could predict or was equipped to handle. At the moment, you're reading this page, we’re not anyone in this pandemic situation, but we want our world to be more prepared for the next one. The goal of this project is to help reduce future virus spread by using Deep Learning neural Networks as a solution to identify people who don’t wear or don’t properly wear their face mask.</p>
