            <p>In 2019, we experienced a pandemic that no one could predict or was equipped to handle. At the moment, you're reading this page, we’re not anyone in this pandemic situation, but we want our world to be more prepared for the next one. The goal of this project is to help reduce future virus spread by using Deep Learning neural Networks as a solution to identify people who don’t wear or don’t properly wear their face mask.</p>

            <p>This project is a data visualization of a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to December 2020, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 1.5 million accident records in this dataset.</p>

            <p>Dr. John Snow's map of London's 1854 cholera epidemic was a true masterpiece. It was the first time that anyone had established a link between contaminated water and cholera..
                Snow's map displayed the locations of cholera cases in the city, and by analyzing the data, he was able to identify a specific water pump on Broad Street as the source of the outbreak. This project aims to recreate Dr. John Snow's map using modern data visualization techniques to showcase the impact of his findings in combating the cholera epidemic.</p>

            <p>This project consists of making a web application working with a database on the back-end. The goal of our project was to create a website to help IU member to socialize and create connection with each other. In the first part of this project, we decide what IU member may need and what we can offer with our website. In the second part, we tried to create the website with the feature we thought might help IU member and finally the last is where we were talking about the limit we face during this project.</p>

            <p>A project on Covid-19 data visualization aims to present the vast amount of information related to the pandemic in a clear and concise manner. Through the use of charts, graphs, maps, and other visual aids, this project seeks to make sense of the data and provide a better understanding of the spread of the virus, its impact on healthcare systems, and the measures being taken to control it.
                The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive and easily accessible view of the situation, so that decision-makers, researchers, and the general public can have access to the latest information and use it to inform their actions.</p>
