                In 2019, we experienced a pandemic that no one could predict or was equipped to handle. At the moment, you're reading this page, we’re not anyone in this pandemic situation, but we want 
                our world to be more prepared for the next one. The goal of this project is to help reduce future virus 
                spread by using Deep Learning neural Networks as a solution to identify people who don’t wear or don’t 
                properly wear their face mask. </br><br>

        <h1> Countrywide car accident Analysis </h1>

            <img src="Project/car.jpeg">
            <p>This project is a data visualization of a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to December 2020, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 1.5 million accident records in this dataset

        <h1> London's 1854 cholera epidemic </h1>
        <div style="display: flex;">
            <img src="Project/cholera.jpeg">
            <p>Dr. John Snow's map of London's 1854 cholera epidemic was a true master piece. It was the first time that anyone had established a link between contaminated water and cholera. The visualization provided compelling evidence and made the case for public health policies to improve water sanitation. The map remains one of the most remarkable and insightful visualizations ever created.</br>
                In this project, you will recreate Dr. John Snow's map using today's tools of trade (D3, to be specific). In addition to recreating the original map in an interactive version, you will add additional charts to the side of the map, as well as interface elements to make the data more interactive.</br><br>

            <p>
                This project consists of making a web application working with a database on the back-end. The goal of our project was to create a website to help IU member to socialize and create connection with each other. In the first part of this project, we decide what IU member may need and what we can offer with our website. In the second part, we tried to create the website with the feature we thought might help IU member and finally the last is where we were talking about the limit we face during this project.

                A project on Covid-19 data visualization aims to present the vast amount of information related to the pandemic in a clear and concise manner. Through the use of charts, graphs, maps, and other visual aids, this project seeks to make sense of the data and provide a better understanding of the spread of the virus, its impact on healthcare systems, and the measures being taken to control it.<br>
                The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive and easily accessible view of the situation, so that decision-makers, researchers, and the general public can have access to the latest information and use it to inform their actions.<br><br>
