        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
        I am Joel-Cedric Beugre, a recent graduate in Applied Data Science with a deep passion for programming and leveraging it to solve real-world problems. I have an insatiable appetite for acquiring new skills and developing new habits that enhance my ability to adapt across a range of domains.
        </p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <p>
        Upon enrolling at Indiana University â€“ Purdue University, I was awarded a scholarship that also came with the position of <b>Graduate Teaching Assistant</b>. I started this role under the guidance of Mathew Powers, a lecturer in media arts and science, and was tasked with conducting research on diverse topics related to the history of video games.
        </p>

        <p>
        Subsequently, I transitioned to working with Bob Green, an adjunct lecturer in Human-Computer Interaction, where I had the opportunity to assist incoming students in learning programming languages like Python.
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>
        Following high school, I started my computer science journey at the International University of Grand Bassam in my country (Ivory Coast ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡®). There, I gained a foundational understanding of computer science and programming. Later, I transferred to Georgia State University to complete my bachelor's degree in the field.
        My experience at Georgia State University was transformative, providing me with an exceptional education and invaluable skills in computer science that have been crucial to my professional growth.
        </p>

        <p>
        As mentioned above, I studied at Indiana University â€“ Purdue University where I obtained my master degree in Applied Data Science to fulfill my interest in databases and the use of data to solve and/or answer questions. My experience at IUPUI was enriching and formative, giving me opportunities to conduct research, work with talented faculty, and contribute to the education of new students. It was a valuable time that strengthened my knowledge and skills in computer science and helped me develop as a professional. I am grateful for the experiences and knowledge gained during my time there.
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

        <p>
        In my spare time, I enjoy watching football matches and highlights, and occasionally playing football myself. As a fan of FC Barcelona, I frequently check social media for news about the team and compare their statistics with those of other teams.
        </p>

        <p>
        Aside from football, I like to learn new programming languages by working on personal projects, as well as reading. Although I am still working on making reading a consistent hobby, I am confident that I will succeed.
