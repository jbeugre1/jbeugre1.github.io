            Greetings! My name is Joel-Cedric Beugre, and I am a recent graduate in Applied Data Science with a strong passion for programming and its applications in solving real-world problems. I have a deep-seated hunger for constantly acquiring new skills and developing new habits that help me stay adaptable across various domains.
        </p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <p>
            My academic journey at Indiana University - Purdue University was enriched by the amazing scholarship opportunity that also landed me the prestigious position of Graduate Teaching Assistant. I was incredibly lucky to work under the wing of Mathew Powers, a renowned lecturer in media arts and science, and explore various topics related to the captivating history of video games.
        </p>

        <p>
            Later on, I was thrilled to join forces with Bob Green, a seasoned adjunct lecturer in Human-Computer Interaction, and immerse myself in the world of programming languages. I took on the responsibility of guiding new students in mastering languages like Python, and it was a rewarding experience to witness their growth and development. All in all, my time as a Graduate Teaching Assistant was an incredible learning experience that shaped me both personally and professionally.
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>
            My exhilarating journey into the world of computer science began at the International University of Grand Bassam in Ivory Coast, where I obtained my foundational knowledge in programming and computer science. But I knew that I was destined for something greater, so I transferred to Georgia State University, where I expanded my horizons and developed essential skills that have been crucial to my professional success.
        </p>

        <p>
            Driven by my thirst for knowledge, I then set my sights on a master's degree in Applied Data Science at Indiana University â€“ Purdue University. This program not only allowed me to delve deeper into databases, but also provided me with the tools to answer complex questions using data. My experience at IUPUI was truly transformative, as I had the privilege of working alongside brilliant faculty members, conducting groundbreaking research, and playing a pivotal role in the education of upcoming generations of students. All in all, my computer science journey has been nothing short of thrilling, and I cannot wait to see what exciting challenges and opportunities lie ahead.
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

        <p>
            I absolutely love my hobbies! Football is one of my favorite sports because it keeps me active, helps me build teamwork skills, and is always a fun time with friends. Programming for fun is something I'm really passionate about because it allows me to express my creativity and learn new skills that can be applied in various areas of life. And AI art is an incredible fusion of technology and art that I find fascinating, inspiring, and thought-provoking. Pursuing my hobbies is essential to my personal growth and wellbeing, and I can't wait to continue exploring them further.
