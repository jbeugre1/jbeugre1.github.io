        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>My name is Joel-Cedric Beugre and I’m a recent graduate in Applied Data Science. I’m passionate by programming and solving real life problem with my programming skill.
            I love discovering new skills and try to adopt new habits to improve my adaptation on different topics.
        </p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <p>
        After joining Indiana University – Purdue University, I was offered the position of Graduate Teaching Assistant as a scholarship. I started under the supervision of Mathew Powers is a lecturer in media arts and science. My first duty was to conduct some research on various issues related to the history of video games.
        </p>

        <p>
        Then, I moved under the supervision of Bob Green, an adjunct lecturer in Human-Computer Interaction, where I had the chance to assist new students with learning programming languages like Python.
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>
        After high school, I started my computer science journey at the International University of Grand Bassam, where I started learning the basis of computer science and computer programming. Then, I transfer to Georgia State University to complete my bachelor degree. 
        </p>

        <p>
        As mentioned above, I studied at Indiana University – Purdue University where I obtained my master degree in Applied Data Science to fulfill my interest in databases and the use of data to solve and/or answer questions.
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

        <p>
        During my free time, I like watching football matches or highlight and when I have the occasion going on the field, I played football. My favorite team is Fc Barcelona, so most of the time, I’m looking for news about the team on social media and watch the team statistic and compare them with other teams.
        </p>

        <p>
            My other hobbies are learning new programming language by doing personal project and reading. I’m still working on making reading a hobby but I’m confident I’ll success.  
        </p>
