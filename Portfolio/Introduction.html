        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
        I am Joel-Cedric Beugre, a recent graduate in Applied Data Science with a deep passion for programming and leveraging it to solve real-world problems. I have an insatiable appetite for acquiring new skills and developing new habits that enhance my ability to adapt across a range of domains.
        </p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <p>
        After joining Indiana University – Purdue University, I was offered the position of Graduate Teaching Assistant as a scholarship. I started under the supervision of Mathew Powers is a lecturer in media arts and science. My first duty was to conduct some research on various issues related to the history of video games.
        </p>

        <p>
        Then, I moved under the supervision of Bob Green, an adjunct lecturer in Human-Computer Interaction, where I had the chance to assist new students with learning programming languages like Python.
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>
            Following high school, I started my computer science journey at the International University of Grand Bassam. There, I gained a foundational understanding of computer science and programming. Later, I transferred to Georgia State University to complete my bachelor's degree in the field.
        </p>

        <p>
        As mentioned above, I studied at Indiana University – Purdue University where I obtained my master degree in Applied Data Science to fulfill my interest in databases and the use of data to solve and/or answer questions.
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

        <p>
        In my spare time, I enjoy watching football matches and highlights, and occasionally playing football myself. As a fan of FC Barcelona, I frequently check social media for news about the team and compare their statistics with those of other teams.
        </p>

        <p>
        Aside from football, I like to learn new programming languages by working on personal projects, as well as reading. Although I am still working on making reading a consistent hobby, I am confident that I will succeed.
        </p>
